# CIFAR10
This is ML, Seoultech Academic course, project repository

<hr>

Overview goes like this

* Parsing Dataset from **_torchvision_**
* Preprocessing
* model comparison
  * Svm with OVR - DONE
  * Decision tree - DONE
  * Random forest - DONE
  * Logistic regression - DONE
  * Ensemble model - DONE with Random forest
  * Neural networks
* By metrics
* Implementation of the model which has the greatest score
* Apply greater model by customized class from latest sota paper and comparing with the earlier model
* DL model
  * VGG16 - DONE
  * RESNET - DONE
* Apply Wandb

<hr>

* TODO:
  * Clustering
  * Apply Grey scale conversion
  * Normalization
  * Data Augmentation
  * Image standardization
