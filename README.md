# CIFAR10
This is ML, Seoultech Academic course, project repository

<hr>

Overview goes like this

* Parsing Dataset from **_torchvision_**
* Preprocessing
* model comparison
  * Svm with OVR - DONE
  * Decision tree - DONE
  * Random forest - DONE
  * Logistic regression - DONE
  * Ensemble model - DONE with Random forest
  * Neural networks (including rnn, cnn)
* By metrics
* Implementation of the model which has the greatest score
* Comparing with the package and myModel(custom)
* Apply greater model by customized class from latest sota paper and comparing with the earlier model
* expansion model
  * VGG16
  * RESNET18
  * MobileNet2
  * SimpleDLA
  * DLA
* Apply Wandb

<hr>

* TODO:
  * Clustering
  * Apply Grey scale conversion
  * Normalization
  * Data Augmentation
  * Image standardization
